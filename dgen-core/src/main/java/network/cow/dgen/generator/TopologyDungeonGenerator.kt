    TODO
    now we have the partitions of the topology, that we want to generate
    seperatedly.
    SO we need an algorithm that just works with one partition (i.e. a specific order
    of vertices) and connects them together.


    We need:
    - list of partitions
    - stack with already placed rooms
    - map with used blueprints for specific rooms
    - `MutatedRoomBlueprint` which holds the transformation and shifting
    - after placing first room, get the second vertex from the partition and check where
    he needs to be placed. the partition is ordered in such a way, that the next room will
    have a room where it can be placed to. then filter the blueprints cause we know what
    kind of room the next vertex is
