    How does the generation work?
    1 Choose initial vertex
    2 Choose a room that fits to this room
    3 If no room fits, go back to the initial step and choose another initial room (if there is any left)
    4 If a room fits, set the new room to this room and do step 1 again.

    WITHOUT BACKTRACKING:
    1. current room and try to find a fit for that
    2. if no fit found: break;
    3. if fit found: add to room and repeat with 1.

    WITH BACKTRACKING:
    - we need a way to keep track on what path we are and what paths
    we already tried.
    - a path is defined like so:
    - spawn001 ==0=> normal001 ==0=> final001
    - BUT that only works with single paths ...
