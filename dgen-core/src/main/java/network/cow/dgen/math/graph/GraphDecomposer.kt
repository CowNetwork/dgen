/**
 * A decomposition algorithm splits the graph in (seemingly) even parts.
 * Normally, doing that correctly would be an NP-complete problem,
 * but we don't want to go overkill.
 * As such, this decomposer just needs to make sure, that the graph is splitted
 * into partitions which are at least a specific size large.
 *
 * Meaning that there are no other hard conditions! Otherwise, as mentioned, we wouldn't
 * be able to develop an efficient algorithm in polynomial time.
