/**
 * Implements the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is an
 * algorithm to traverse a graph structure.
 *
 * It works by starting at a vertex and exploring the neighbor vertices and
 * doing that repeatedly, until every vertex of the graph has been visited.
 *
 * In our case we have a queue, where every vertex we yet have to visit is enqueued.
 * If a vertex has been enqueued, we also mark it as visited, as in graphs we could
 * encounter a cycle, which would result in visiting a vertex twice.
 *
 * **Time complexity**:
 * Let V be the number of vertices and E the number of edges.
 * Then the complexity is given as **O(V + E)**
